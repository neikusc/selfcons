This program was to calculate the magnetization and charge density of multiorbital Hubbard model Hamiltonians for the undoped parent compounds of the Fe-pnictide superconductors.
See article: http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.79.104510

Here I applied Householder's method and QL algorithm for matrix diagonalization, gradient descent for magnetization and charge density, sort algorithms for Fermi level, parallel simulation was with MPI.
